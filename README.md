ML for Sustainability: Satellite Data Processing for Detecting Pollution Sources Mandatory Task for IIT gandhinagar
**Introduction:**
Air pollution stands as a primary cause of mortality worldwide, with brick kilns significantly contributing to its exacerbation. Unlike other pollution sources, monitoring brick kilns proves challenging. Conventional survey-based methods for kiln identification are both costly and time-consuming. This project proposes the implementation of computer vision and machine learning models to efficiently detect brick kilns using low-label satellite imagery. Through this approach, we aim to revolutionize kiln monitoring, contributing to effective pollution control and public health preservation.
**Real-world examples of the implementation of such technology include:**
**India**: In India, where brick kilns are a significant source of pollution, the government has initiated efforts to monitor and regulate their operations. By utilizing satellite imagery coupled with machine learning algorithms, authorities can identify illegal or unregistered kilns more effectively and enforce environmental regulations.
**Bangladesh**: Bangladesh has one of the highest concentrations of brick kilns globally. The government, in collaboration with international organizations, is exploring the use of remote sensing and AI technologies to monitor kiln emissions and enforce pollution control measures.
**China**: China, as a leading producer of bricks, faces challenges in controlling brick kiln emissions. The country has invested in satellite-based monitoring systems to track kiln activity and enforce emission standards, contributing to improvements in air quality in heavily industrialized regions.

Introduction
This project aims to classify animal images into various categories using deep learning techniques. It leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks to learn and recognize patterns within the images. The dataset used consists of images belonging to different animal categories.
The dataset comprises 90 different animal images. Initially, we'll structure it for one-vs-rest classification, followed by binary classification and then a 5-class classification problem. We'll evaluate each model's performance using classification matrices.
**Prerequisites**
Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
Python (>= 3.6)
TensorFlow (>= 2.0)
Keras (>= 2.0)
NumPy

**Results**
The project achieves the following results:
Binary classification (Snake vs. Not Snake): 99.4% accuracy
Multi-class classification (5 classes): 98.5% accuracy
You can find detailed performance metrics and visualizations in the Results section of the main.py file.
